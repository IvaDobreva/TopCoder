5. Create new Community called "CrowdExchange" Use the Wizard and select the "Visualforce Template".  You'll need the URL for Search Member Email template/Custom Setting below.
6. Go to Setup > Administer > Manage Users > Public Groups.  We need to create 3 public group:  "Crowd Exchange Members", "Crowd Exchange Publishers", and "Crowd Exchange Users".  Add all “Publisher” users in “Crowd Exchange Publishers” public group. Add all “Member” users in “Crowd Exchange Members”. Add those 2 public groups in “Crowd Exchange Users”.

Deployment

3  Deploy the sources directly via ant using the Force.com Migration Tools using the "ant deployCode" target.
 - Caution: In that case, you can overwrite current customization. Ant and saleforce-ant deployment tool is included to the submission

Post Deployment:
1. Update the CE_CrowdExchangeSettings__c: 
    -- NotificationsCounterUpdateInterval__c = 30
    -- Site_Url__c: community url. Used in “Search member” template
2. Assign the appropriate permission set to the User that you're planning to use to access the application.  Users will either be assigned to the Crowd Exchange Member Permission Set, the Crowd Exchange Publisher Permission Set, or the Crowd Exchange Admin Permission Set.
3. Navigation through the application requires users to have the User.Crowd_Exchange_User_Type field populated.  Please validate that all users which access the site have this field populated.  This will be a moot point when authentication is working properly.
4. Insert the milestones, skills, and default requirements into the system using the anonymous Apex code found in milestones.txt, skills.txt, defaultrequirements.txt.  An anonymous Apex window can be opened in the developer console.
5. Enable feed tracking for the Activity object. This can be found under Settings->Chatter->Feed Tracking.
