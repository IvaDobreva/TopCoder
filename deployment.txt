Prerequisites -- These step MUST be performed in order to deploy this code.
1. Procure a SFDC Developer org.

2. Update the build.xml and build.properties files for your local environment
3  Deploy the sources directly via ant using the Force.com Migration Tools using the "ant deployCode" target.

Post Deployment:
1. - Update the CrowdExchangeSettings__c: 
    -- NotificationsCounterUpdateInterval__c = 30
    -- Site_Url__c: community url. Used in “Search member” template
2.  Goto FLS for Users. Enable all the Crowd_Exchange custom fields for users.  Since we're not migrating profiles these tend to be hidden post-deployment.  You should set your admin user either as a publisher or member and/or create other member and publiser users in the system using the Crowd_Exchange_User_Type field.  The fields are:
    -- Crowd_Exchange_User_Type__c
    -- Crowd_Exchange_About_Me__c
